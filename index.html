	<p> For those of you unfamiliar with Civilization 5, I have included an introductory video created by the wonderful people at IGN. </p>

		<h1> The Perfect Opponent </h1>
		<p> One of the most important parts of any civilization game is deciding who you will play as. I chose the English. Aside from being one of the closest civilizations geographically to the French, they also have a host of useful bonuses. An extra spy and an extra two movement for naval units will ensure that I rule the seas. </p>

		<h1> Humble Beginning </h1>
		<p> And so my journey of conquest begins. London is founded, but my mortal enemy is not far.</p>

		<h1> They Call It "The English Channel" for a Reason.</h1>
		<p> An essential part of my plan is discoving sailing. Not only does it allow me to build powerful war ships, but it also lets me move my armies across the English Channel.</p>

		<h1> The Backing of the Gods </h1>
		<p> I found my first pantheon, "God of the Sea." This gives me extra production to build units from all my fishing boats.</p>

		<h1> An Iron Fist </h1>
		<p> My third city, Nottingham, is founded in central England. This city is important because it links iron to my empire, which will soon be crafted into dozens of vicious swordsmen.</p>
